This is for the gate counter magnetometer sensor to be able to count the number of vehicles exiting the park and publish counts via MQTT to HiveMQ when WiFi is connected. This has been a challenge caused by only having one magnetometer sensor and tons of variation while cars are exiting. When exiting normally, the code works great. However, if there are backups or turn-arounds the code tends to fail. The addition of an optical sensor should solve these problems and will be worked on over the summer for next year. In the mean time, a new branch will be created for tracking cars during the summer months when no WiFi is present.
